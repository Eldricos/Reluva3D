# The id Tech 3 engine

Engine id `idtech3`, in `src/engines/idtech3/`. First game: Star Trek:
Voyager - Elite Force (`stvef`).

## Why one engine for a family of games

Like ScummVM's SCUMM engine, which runs many games, this engine is meant
for every game built on the Quake III Arena engine (Elite Force, Quake III
Arena, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy,
Soldier of Fortune II...). What they share (pk3 search paths, shader
scripts, BSP maps, MD3 models) is written once here. What differs is keyed
off a `GameInfo` entry in `games.cpp`. Game-specific code will go in
subfolders (`src/engines/idtech3/eliteforce/`) when there is some.

Code that isn't specific to id Tech 3 goes in `src/common/` so any engine
can use it: zip archives, the `Archive`/`SearchSet` file system, image
decoding, audio. The engine never touches SDL; it uses `System`, like
every engine.

## Where it stands

| Part | State |
|---|---|
| Detection | Elite Force: one Windows release by pak0.pk3's hash; other releases by file names, shown as "unknown release" |
| File system | done: `baseEF` loose files over its paks, later paks first (`filesystem.cpp`, [pk3.md](../formats/idtech3/pk3.md)) |
| Text files | done: tokenizer ([text.md](../formats/idtech3/text.md)) and entity lump |
| Shader scripts | every Quake III directive parsed into typed fields, unknown ones listed (`reluva-tool shader-check`) ([shader.md](../formats/idtech3/shader.md)) |
| Maps | every BSP lump read and validated; all 67 retail maps load ([bsp.md](../formats/idtech3/bsp.md)) |
| Images | TGA, JPEG, PNG (`common/image.cpp`) |
| Models | MD3 with every frame, tags, `.skin` files, players put together from their parts, lit by the light grid in maps ([md3.md](../formats/idtech3/md3.md)); placed where entities name a model; Elite Force's MDR models with their levels of detail; items and characters as the game code places them |
| Game code | QVM interpreter done and tested against compiler output ([qvm.md](../formats/idtech3/qvm.md)). Elite Force's system calls worked out from its own code ([eliteforce-syscalls.md](../formats/idtech3/eliteforce-syscalls.md)); the menus' calls implemented (`eliteforce/ui_host.cpp`, `reluva-tool ui-run`): console variables, files, registering, drawing. The Menu page runs them and draws them with the GPU renderer, with the keyboard and mouse; on the retail game the setup, CD key and main menus work, with their 3D models (the player in Player settings): the scenes both programs hand over are recorded by `eliteforce/scene.cpp` and drawn by `scene_drawer.cpp`, each RenderScene over the pictures drawn before it with depths cleared, those without the level lit evenly from above as the original lights them. While the client game loads, its UpdateScreen calls draw its loading screen (its frame drawn in the middle of its start-up, as the original does). qagame starts a level (`eliteforce/game_host.cpp`, `reluva-tool game-run`): its entities spawn and link, with collision against the map (`collision.cpp`, curved patches included; areas as the original's: an entity's one or two areas found when it's linked, the game opening and closing the portal a door stands in (AdjustAreaPortalState), InPvs not seeing through a closed one, AreasConnected, the original's cm_noAreas to join them all; the Play page's info line counts the sight checks a closed door blocked; not yet: snapshots leaving out what's behind closed doors, which needs Elite Force's broadcast flag), and a player joins and moves. The client game (`eliteforce/cgame_host.cpp`) takes snapshots and the player's commands, draws the HUD and builds the 3D scene. The Play page runs both each frame with the keyboard and mouse (through key bindings: the game's `default.cfg`, changed in the menus' Controls and kept in `reluva.cfg` in the save folder; `bindings.cpp`), and draws the level from the player's eye with the HUD over it. The engine's settings from the menus apply: brightness (r_gamma, a final pass on the GPU raising each colour to 1/gamma, as the original's hardware gamma), mouse speed and inversion (sensitivity, m_pitch, m_yaw), smooth mouse (m_filter), free look (cl_freelook), key turn speeds (cl_yawspeed, cl_pitchspeed, cl_anglespeedkey), always run (cl_run), dynamic lights (r_dynamiclight) and screen size (the client game's view rectangle). The screenshot command (and screenshotjpeg, also as a TGA) saves the next frame, without Reluva's info lines, as `screenshots/shot0000.tga` (the first number free) or the name given, in the save folder; `screenshot silent` says nothing, as the original. Sounds play through `sound_system.cpp` as the client game asks (calls 28 to 35, Quake III's): placed in the world or following entities, full volume within 80 units then fading by 0.0008 a unit, panned by the listener's right; no sound cutting another (as ioq3's S_StartSound: the same sound on the same entity within 50 ms is skipped as a repeat; ioq3's cap of 5 copies of one sound per entity is left out, as it silenced rapid fire); looping sounds re-added each frame; the music's intro then its loop; at s_volume and s_musicvolume. The video settings apply too (`videoSettings()` in `viewers.cpp`, read when a page is shown, and again when the menus run vid_restart, which starts the menus over as the original does; the engine's settings are registered as kept, so they're saved in `reluva.cfg`): resolution (r_mode, Quake III's list of sizes, or r_customwidth/height for -1; the frame is drawn at that size and letterboxed in the window, which takes that size when it fits on the screen), fullscreen (r_fullscreen, at the desktop's mode), texture detail (r_picmip: textures halved that many times with a 2x2 box filter, but for shaders marked nopicmip), texture filter (r_texturemode, GL_ names; r_ext_texture_filter_anisotropic, 16x), neither applying to pictures (menus, HUD), which the original loads without mipmaps, lighting (r_vertexLight: the level lit by its vertex colours instead of lightmaps), geometric detail (r_subdivisions: curves drawn straying at most that many units from round, as the original's, and bullet marks on them following; r_lodBias: models' `_1`/`_2` lower details, and MDR models' own levels of detail; and lower levels with distance, as the original chooses them) and simple sky (r_fastsky: the sky left black). |
| Viewer | Menu (the game's own menus), Play (a Holomatch level run by the game's own code), World (3D, with entities' models), Models, Maps (wireframe), Textures and Files pages |
| Renderer | every shader stage with its blend, depth, alpha test, rgbGen/alphaGen, tcGen/tcMod and animMap; deformVertexes wave/bulge/move; sort order (as the original's: everything in a view, the level's surfaces, models and effects alike, drawn by its shader's sort, the solid ones first with the dynamic lights over them); sky boxes and cloud layers; fog volumes (by camera distance); the original's implicit shaders and light scaling ([shader.md](../formats/idtech3/shader.md)). Dynamic lights. Models' levels of detail as the original chooses them (each model's radius as seen, then r_lodbias). Visibility as the original's renderer: in the Play page only the level's surfaces in leaves whose cluster the eye's can see (the vis data) and whose area a closed door doesn't hide (the snapshot's area mask, which the server works out from the player's area and the open doors, handed back in the view at refdef_t's byte 80) are drawn, worked out again when the cluster or the mask changes; then, each frame the view moves, only those whose bounds are inside the view's four sides (from its matrix) go in the frame's index list, uploaded into a reused, cycled GPU buffer. Mirrors and portals as the original's renderer: the nearest mirror or portal surface in view with a portal entity (type 8, Quake III's portal surface one on) within 64 units of its plane, a portal within its shader's alphaGen portal range; its camera the mirror's reflection or the portal's (old origin, axes, turning by frame, old frame and skin number); that view drawn first inside the surface's shape (marked in the stencil), clipped at its plane (an oblique near plane), turned inside out for a mirror, with its own culling; then the surface's depth and the main view over it, the portal's shader blending over. The player's body is seen in mirrors, their weapon isn't. Autosprites as the original's: the level's autosprite surfaces kept aside and rebuilt as drawn, each quad facing the camera round its middle (autosprite) or turned about its long axis (autosprite2, the fire shaders), in mirrors too; not yet on models |
| Sound | sounds by name, decoded once (`sounds.cpp`), mixed by `common/audio`'s mixer; the menus' sounds; in the Play page sounds placed in the world, looping sounds and music (`sound_system.cpp`) |

## Next steps

1. **Check against the retail data.** Done for maps (all 67 load) and
   detection (one release); the retail paks are read; Elite Force's
   shaders use no directive outside Quake III's. Still to do: write down
   any Elite Force-specific entity keys, and detect its other releases
   (the Expansion Pack, the Mac and other-language versions).
2. **3D rendering in `System`.** Done: `gfx::Renderer3D` in
   `src/common/gfx3d.h` (textures, static meshes, draw calls with blend,
   depth, cull and alpha-test state, a 2D overlay), reached through
   `System::init3D`. The SDL3 backend implements it with SDL's GPU API
   (`src/backends/sdl3/sdl_gpu.cpp`) on the same GPU device as SDL's
   renderer, which the launcher keeps using. Shaders: see
   `src/backends/sdl3/shaders/build.sh`. Vulkan is tested: Mesa's software driver on Linux, and an
   NVIDIA RTX 2080 on Windows (Visual Studio 2022 build), where retail maps
   run at the monitor's 144 Hz with about 1.2 ms of CPU time per frame.
   The Metal path
   (macOS) is generated but untested.
3. **World renderer**, continued: autosprites, mirrors, culling (by the
   vis data, areas and the view) and drawing order are done; still to
   do: fog by depth inside the volume. Translucent surfaces are drawn as
   the original sorts them, by their shaders' sorts across the level,
   models and effects; like the original, not by distance.
   Checked against the original: retail maps look right at 144 fps on an
   RTX 2080, and Elite Force's 1872 shaders use no directive outside
   Quake III's; their autosprite2 fire and portal/mirror shaders are
   drawn too.
4. **Models**: done for MD3 and Elite Force's MDR, with interpolation
   between frames and the players' `animation.cfg` (the Models page plays
   them in pairs), and every level of detail. Players show in the Play
   page and the menus. Shadows are the client game's own marks
   (cg_shadows 1); still to do: the renderer's stencil and projected
   shadows (r_shadows 2 and 3, which Elite Force's menus don't offer).
5. **Bots**: done: they join, their library reads the `.aas` map with
   areas and routes, characters and the bots' input, and they choose
   goals and weapons, follow routes (lifts included), predict moves and
   chat ([aas.md](../formats/idtech3/aas.md)). They don't answer chat:
   the retail data has no reply file for them.
6. **Sound**: done in the Play page: sounds placed in the world, looping
   sounds and music, as the client game asks.
7. **Game code**: see below.

## Game code: open questions

The renderer and file formats are the shared, well-documented part. The
game logic is the hard part, and there are several possible routes. Each
one has to be checked before anything is written:

- **Licences.** Reluva's own code is all new. The GPL Quake III Arena
  source (id's 2005 release, ioquake3) may be read as documentation of the
  formats the games share, never copied.
- **Raven's Elite Force game source is off-limits.** The single-player
  game source Raven published in 2002 (the "STEF Game Source", expansion
  version) comes under Raven's *Limited Use Software License Agreement*,
  not the GPL. It allows only modifications that run with the retail game,
  and forbids derivative works, reverse engineering and translation. Don't
  copy it, and don't read it to write Reluva code; treat it like the leaked
  source CONTRIBUTING.md warns about. The same goes for the multiplayer SDK
  unless it turns out to carry a GPL-compatible licence. It also wouldn't
  help with the shared formats: by its own ReadMe it holds only the game
  DLLs' code, not the executable's renderer or map loading.
- **Holomatch (multiplayer)**: `pak0.pk3` holds `vm/qagame.qvm` (server
  game logic), `vm/cgame.qvm` (client: HUD, effects, prediction) and
  `vm/ui.qvm` (menus): game logic as Quake III VM bytecode. So the original
  logic can run in a QVM interpreter, with the engine providing the
  system calls it makes, the way ScummVM runs games' own scripts. The
  bytecode stays in the user's copy; Reluva only runs it.
  - The QVM file format and instruction set are the same as Quake III's,
    documented in the GPL source and community write-ups, so the
    interpreter is new code written from that documentation.
  - The system calls (numbers, arguments and meanings) are Elite Force's
    own. They have to be worked out from the bytecode in an owned copy
    (reverse engineering for interoperability, allowed by CONTRIBUTING.md
    where local law permits) and from Quake III's documented ones where
    they match, never from Raven's SDK.
  - Probably only Holomatch uses the QVMs; single player has its DLLs. To
    confirm.
- **Single player**: its logic ships as native x86 code
  (`efgamex86.dll`, with the menus in `efuix86.dll`), which a portable
  engine can't load. It would have to be reimplemented from
  observed behaviour and the map data (entities, scripts), following
  CONTRIBUTING.md.
