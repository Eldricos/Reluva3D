# id Tech 3: `.pk3` archives and the search path

Status: **implemented**; checked on archives built by Python's `zipfile`
and by the tests, and on the retail Elite Force paks, from which the
levels, models, sounds and game code all load.
Readers: `src/common/zip.cpp` (the archive), `src/engines/idtech3/filesystem.cpp`
(the search order).

Sources: PKWARE's published `APPNOTE.TXT` for the zip format; the search
order from the Quake III Arena source id Software released under the GPL
(`code/qcommon/files.c`, `FS_AddGameDirectory`), read for behaviour, not
copied.

## Format

A `.pk3` is an ordinary zip file. Entries are stored (method 0) or
deflated (method 8). Reluva reads the central directory at the end of the
file, then each entry's local header for where its data starts (the local
name and extra field lengths can differ from the central directory's).
Every read is checked against the entry's CRC-32.

Not supported, and not expected in game data: encryption, Zip64, archives
split over several files.

## Search order

A game folder (`baseEF` for Elite Force) is searched in this order, first
match wins:

1. loose files in the folder and its subfolders;
2. the folder's `.pk3` files, the last name first, comparing names in
   upper case (so `_` sorts after the letters): `pak2.pk3` before
   `pak1.pk3` before `pak0.pk3`, and `pak_x.pk3` before `paka.pk3`. That's
   how patches replace files: they add a later pak.

A mod's folder goes on top of the base game's, in the same order inside it
(`mountGameDir`'s `layer`). File names are matched ignoring case, with `\`
and `/` treated alike.

## Checksums

Each pk3 is known by a checksum (Quake III's, read for behaviour from
the GPL source): the CRC-32 of every file in it that isn't empty, in the
central directory's order, as 32-bit little-endian words; the MD4 of
those bytes; and the digest's four little-endian words XORed together.
A pure server's checksum of a pak (for the `cp` check,
[eliteforce-network.md](eliteforce-network.md)) is the same with the
server's checksum feed as a first word. `reluva-tool pk3-sums <game
folder> [feed]` prints them (`src/engines/idtech3/pure.cpp`). The GPL
engine that runs Elite Force knows the retail paks by theirs: `pak0.pk3`
3376297517, `pak1.pk3` 596947475, `pak2.pk3` 3960871590, `pak3.pk3`
1592359207; `pk3-sums` gives the same for the retail paks (October 2026),
and joining a pure retail server with them works.

## Elite Force

A Windows install seen in October 2026 holds a single 566,234,769-byte
`baseEF/pak0.pk3`, next to `efconfig.cfg` and `hmconfig.cfg` (single-player
and Holomatch settings) and no other paks. Its detection entry is in
`src/engines/idtech3/games.cpp`.

The install folder also holds both executables (`stvoy.exe` for single
player, `stvoyHM.exe` for Holomatch), the native game and menu code
(`efgamex86.dll`, `efuix86.dll`) and the Bink video player
(`binkw32.dll`): the cinematics are Bink videos in the paks
(`video/<name>.bik`, see [bink.md](../../../common/bink.md)).

`pak0.pk3` holds 67 maps and a `vm/` folder with `qagame.qvm`,
`cgame.qvm` and `ui.qvm` (see `docs/engines/idtech3/README.md`).

The patches and the Expansion Pack add paks: `pak1.pk3` (1.1),
`pak2.pk3` (1.2, both with new game code in `vm/`) and `pak3.pk3` (the
Expansion Pack: its maps, Virtual Voyager and the holodeck missions; no
`vm/`). Each is recognised by its hash (`src/engines/idtech3/games.cpp`).
**Still to check with owned copies:** the hashes of other releases
(`reluva --hash baseEF/pak0.pk3`).
