# id Tech 3: compiled maps (`maps/*.bsp`)

Status: **all lumps read and cross-checked** (`src/engines/idtech3/bsp.cpp`);
the light grid is kept raw. **Verified on all 67 retail Elite Force maps**
(`reluva-tool idtech3 bsp-check`, October 2026): every one is version 46 with the
record sizes below, and 27 of them need the corrections described at the
end.

Sources: the GPL Quake III Arena source (`code/qcommon/qfiles.h`, the map
compiler and renderer) and the community's "Unofficial Quake 3 Map Specs".

All values are little-endian. Integers are 32-bit signed, floats IEEE
single precision.

|---|---|---|
| 0 | i32 | shader |
| 4 | i32 | fog (−1 = none) |
| 8 | i32 | type: 1 polygon, 2 patch, 3 triangle soup (models), 4 flare |

| 20 | i32 × 2 | first index, index count |
| 28 | i32 | lightmap (negative = none) |
| 32 | i32 × 2 | position in the lightmap |
| 40 | i32 × 2 | size in the lightmap |
| 48 | f32[3] | lightmap origin in the world |
| 60 | f32[3][3] | lightmap s and t vectors and the surface normal; for patches, [0] and [1] are the patch's bounds instead |
| 96 | i32 × 2 | patch width and height in control points |

Patches are grids of quadratic Bézier patches: width × height control
points (both odd), each 3×3 block one patch, sharing edges. The engine
tessellates them; the file holds only the control points. For a patch,
the bounds in the lightmap vectors are those of its *group*: the patches
q3map wants cut alike so they meet. Patches with the same group bounds
are stitched together (below).

### Cutting patches for drawing

As the original's renderer, and Reluva's (`patch.cpp`, `subdividePatch`):

1. **Across.** For each run of three control points across the grid
   (columns 0-2, 2-4...), the curve's midpoint, (a + 2b + c) / 4, is
   measured against the line from a to c, on every row; the worst
   decides. Under 0.1 units, the run is straight. Over `r_subdivisions`
   (4 by default), every row's run is halved at the middle (a, b, c
   become a, (a+b)/2, middle, (b+c)/2, c) and both halves are looked at
   again. Never more than 65 points across.
2. **Down.** The same for the columns, on the grid step 1 made.
3. **Onto the curve.** Each point between two others (odd positions)
   becomes half itself plus a quarter of each neighbour, down the
   columns first, then along the rows.
4. **Straight runs** found in steps 1 and 2 lose their middle column or
   row.
5. **Normals** come from the grid's shape: at each point, the directions
   to its eight neighbours (the next one that isn't on top of it, up to
   three away; across the seam of a grid whose first and last columns or
   rows meet), the cross products of each two neighbouring directions
   averaged.
6. **Stitching.** Where a patch's edge has a point that the matching
   edge of another patch in its group lacks (both ends of that edge's
   piece the same within 0.1 units), the other gets a column or row
   through it: halfway between its neighbours on every row, at the point
   on the edge. Without this, the two edges wouldn't meet: a hairline
   crack.

The original also drops columns and rows by distance as it draws (the
farther the patch, the more; `r_lodCurveError`), keeping the groups'
shared points alike. Reluva always draws every point, which is the
original at close range.

## The light grid

Light sampled on a regular grid, for lighting models. Cells are 64 × 64 ×
128 units unless the worldspawn entity's `gridsize` key says otherwise.
Grid points lie on multiples of the cell size inside the world model's
bounds: from ceil(mins / size) × size to floor(maxs / size) × size on each
axis, X fastest, then Y, then Z. If the lump's size doesn't match, the
original ignores the grid.

Colours are stored at half brightness like lightmaps (doubled, keeping the
hue). The direction is two angles × 2π/256: longitude (byte 6) from +Z,
latitude (byte 7) around it, giving (cos lat · sin lng, sin lat · sin lng,
cos lng).

To light a point the original blends the eight surrounding grid points by
distance, skipping any that are all black (inside walls) and rescaling
the rest, normalizes the blended direction, then adds 32 to the ambient
light (capped at 255). `src/engines/idtech3/light_grid.cpp`; read from the
GPL renderer's `tr_bsp.c` and `tr_light.c`.

## Collision

How Reluva moves things through a map (`collision.cpp`; the behaviour is
Quake III's, the code Reluva's own). Brushes are convex volumes, each the
intersection of the half-spaces behind its sides' planes, with the
contents of its shader (`solid`, `playerclip`, `water`...); the compiler
adds bevel planes so boxes slide along edges properly. A trace sweeps an
axis-aligned box from a start to an end: the box is made symmetric about
its centre, and each plane is pushed out by how far the box reaches along
its normal (the sum of `|normal[i]| * halfSize[i]`), which turns the box
into a point. Through the BSP tree, the swept box goes down whichever
sides of each node's plane it touches, to the leaves, and is clipped
against the leaves' brushes (each brush once per trace) whose contents
share a bit with the mask: the line is inside a brush between the last
plane it enters and the first it leaves. The move stops 1/8 unit short
of what it hits, so the next move doesn't start inside it. A trace that
starts inside a brush reports `startSolid`, and `allSolid` when it ends
inside too. Brush models (`*1`, `*2`... for doors and lifts) have no tree
of their own: their brushes are tested directly, in the model's own
coordinates.

A brush model that stands somewhere else and is turned (an entity's
origin and angles: pitch, yaw, roll) is traced as the original's
`CM_TransformedBoxTrace` does (`CollisionWorld::transformedTrace`):

1. The moving box is made even about its middle, and the move shifted by
   that middle, then by the model's origin.
2. If the model is turned, the move's two ends are turned into the
   model's own axes: each the dot products with its forward, left and up
   (Quake III's angle vectors, right negated). The box itself isn't
   turned, as the original's (turning it would spoil the brushes'
   bevels), so a turned model's collision with a box is approximate,
   exactly as in the original.
3. A hit plane's normal is turned back by the same axes, and the end is
   worked out again along the move in the world.

Points are tested the same way (`CM_TransformedPointContents`): moved by
the origin, then turned into the model's axes. The temporary box model
is never turned. Both games' servers, their client games and the game's
entity-contact test all go through these.

Curved surfaces (patches) collide too, when their shader's contents
share a bit with the mask. They are found through the leaves' surface
lists, or a brush model's surfaces. Each patch is cut into triangles
once, when the map loads. The more its control points bend, the finer it
is cut: twice the square root of its largest bend in units, 2 to 16 cuts
per 3×3 block, so the triangles stay within about a tenth of a unit of
the curve. Each triangle collides like a thin brush, bounded by its own
plane facing both ways (half a unit out on each side), its three edges
(a tenth of a unit wide, which covers the thin wedge left between two
triangles on the inside of a bend, while the ridge it leaves on the
outside is about a hundredth of a unit) and its bounding box. A move starting inside one isn't held there, so nothing sticks to
the patch it stands on. As a big curve has thousands of triangles, they
are kept in runs of 16 (neighbours, as cut) under one box, and runs of
16 runs under another, so a trace skips most of them at once. Reluva's
own solution, not the original's code.

## What the reader checks

Every lump lies inside the file and holds whole records; every index into
another lump is in range (node planes and children, leaf ranges, model and
brush ranges, surface shaders, vertices and indices); a patch's size
matches its vertex count; vis data covers every cluster. Errors name the
record, the field and its value, e.g. `BSP surface 0: index 2 is vertex 3
(of 3)`. The rest of the engine relies on this and doesn't check again.

### Tolerated, as the original engine does

Some Elite Force maps hold values out of range that the original engine
accepts. Reluva corrects them the same way and counts them (`Bsp::fixes`,
shown in the map viewer and by `reluva-tool idtech3 bsp-check`):

| Value | Original behaviour | Reluva sets |
|---|---|---|
| surface lightmap ≥ lightmap count | lit by its vertex colours | lightmap −1 |
| surface fog that doesn't exist | not checked | fog −1 |
| flare (or bad surface) with vertices or indices | never used | no vertices or indices |
| unknown surface type | (ioquake3 refuses the map) | type 0, never drawn |

The original's behaviour was read from the GPL Quake III Arena renderer
(`tr_bsp.c`, `tr_shader.c`). The last row is more lenient than Quake III,
since Elite Force's engine may differ; maps that need it show up in
`bsp-check`'s counts.
