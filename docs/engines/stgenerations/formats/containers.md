# Archives and standard files

From STG-Engine's notes on the 2 CD Windows release ([README](README.md) says how they were made). All values are little-endian.

## Containers

| File | Format | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `DATA/*.DAT`, `GENS/*.DAT` | ZIP (stored + deflated) | One archive per location, plus `COMMON.DAT`, `OPTIONS.DAT`, `COMBAT.DAT`, `STELLAR.DAT`. Read by `src/common/zip.h`. |
| `GENS/MUSIC.1`, `MUSIC.2` | ZIP (stored) | 196 stereo 22 kHz WAV music tracks, including `WIN*`, `LOSE*`, `TIMEOUT*`, `LOOP*`, `CREDITS`. |
| `GENS/MOVIE/*.AVI` | AVI | Cinepak video, 640x320 at 24 fps, with 22 kHz 16-bit stereo PCM audio, interleaved in `rec ` lists. The first frame is `00db`, the rest `00id`. Decoded by `src/common/video/avi.h` and `cinepak.h`. |

Each location archive (e.g. `VERID1.DAT`) holds a `verid1/` folder with
`GAME.BIN`, `GAME.LV2`, `*.GS2`, `*.BMP`, `*.OVR` and `sounds/*.WAV`.

## Standard formats inside the archives

- **BMP:** 8-bit Windows bitmaps, each with its own palette.
- **WAV:** 16-bit PCM. Speech is 22 kHz mono; music is 22 kHz stereo.
- **TXT:** for each speech sample `sounds/XXXX0000.WAV` there is a
  `sounds/XXXX0000.TXT` subtitle, e.g. `RIKER: "..."`. Some `.TXT` files are
  other things: `sounds/worlds.txt` is a list of WAV names, and `BRIEFING.TXT`
  is a mission briefing.
