Loose files in the game folder, in standard formats: MP3 (decoded by the
Miles Sound System's `.asi` plugin) and WAV. From a directory listing,
October 2026; the files themselves haven't been examined yet.

## Voice-overs (`FedVO`, `KlingVO`, `RomVO`)

MP3s named after the mission and a number from 005 (`F1005`, `K12009`,
`J1R011`; joint missions carry the side's letter: `J1F`, `J1K`, `J1R`):

| Folder | Missions | Files |
|---|---|---|
| `FedVO` | F1 (005-015), F2 (005-012), F3 (005-017), F8 (005-014), F12 (005-010), F14 (005-013); J1F (005, 006, 010-021), J2F-J9F | 135 |
| `KlingVO` | K1 (005-013), K2 (005-012), K7 (005-013), K8 (005-015), K12 (005-013, plus a `K12009A`), K14 (005-011); J1K-J9K | 124 |
| `RomVO` | R1 (005-013), R2 (005-016, no 012), R8 (005-014), R9 (005-014), R12 (005-009), R14 (005-010); J1R-J9R (each without gaps from 005: J1R, J2R to 011, J3R, J6R, J7R to 013, J4R to 015, J8R, J9R to 009) | 113 |

Exactly the missions with text in the side's misc archive (`fedmisc`,
`klimisc`, `rommisc`; no J5), mission 14 with its own recordings though it
reuses 12's map.

**The recordings are speeches, not the strings read aloud.** Heard
(October 2026): `F1005` (34 s) opens the briefing, "I wish I could be there
to brief you in person but the…"; `F1012` (6 s) "This mineral field should
supply complete resources…"; `F1013` (11 s) "While the Taubat government
is desperate to involve the Federation…"; `F1015` (10 s) "The situation
couldn't be much worse, you'll be caught between the greed…".

**They're the briefing's narration, in number order.** In a recording of
F1 being played ([play-f1.md](play-f1.md)) the briefing steps through the
mission table's pages, each lasting as long as its clip: `F1005` starts
with the first page (STELLAR CARTOGRAPHY, string 2), `F1012` with the
mining advisory (9), `F1013` with the next (10) and `F1015` on the closing
emblem screen; the other clips' lengths fit the steps between. In a
recording of K1 ([play-k1.md](play-k1.md)) all nine of its clips were found,
each starting with its page, and likewise in K2, J1 and J2
([play-k2.md](play-k2.md), [play-j1k.md](play-j1k.md),
[play-j2k.md](play-j2k.md)). **One clip per briefing step, in number
order**, usually opening with STELLAR CARTOGRAPHY and PLANETARY DATA (J3
opens with its INCOMING TRANSMISSION page, [play-j3k.md](play-j3k.md)). Which page each
step shows is the mission's own: usually the table's heading pages in
order without the transmission ones, but J2 shows its pages out of the
table's order, leaves some out and plays four clips over views with no
page, so the briefing is scripted per mission like the rest of it. In K7
([play-k7.md](play-k7.md)) six of the nine clips play over the emblem
screen with no page at all. A lettered clip (`K12009A`) is an extra step
between its number and the next ([play-k12.md](play-k12.md)).

**Format:** MPEG-2 Layer III, 64 kbit/s, 22,050 Hz, mono, with an ID3v2
tag naming the original file (`F1005.WAV`) and the encoder (SoundJam MP).

## Announcements (`Misc`)

WAV files, the same for every mission:

- **Building complete** (`com`), one per building type and side:
  Klingon `A_k…com` (17: `ka` accommodation, `kams`, `kapg`, `kch` colony
  hub, `kcy` construction yard, `kdt`, `klf` livestock farm, `kms` mining
  station, `kpg` power generator, `kpht` photon artillery, `krp` resource
  processor, `ksb` sickbay, `ksf`, `ksg` static gun, `kss` science
  station, `ktp` transporter pad, `kvy` vehicle yard), Federation
  `B_f…com` (17: `fab`, `fams`, `fapg`, `fcy`, `fhf` hydroponics farm,
  `fms`, `fpg`, `fpht`, `fpt`, `frp`, `fsb`, `fsby`, `fsc`, `fsf`, `fsg`,
  `ftp`, `fvy`), Romulan `B_r…com` (10). `fed01.stb`'s "Vehicle yard
  completed, Sir." is such a message.
- **Events**, per side (`f`, `k`, `r`): `atckvoc` (under attack),
  `lowpowr` (low power), `miswin` / `mislose` (mission won / lost),
  `objmet` (objective met).
- **Eight lines per side**, each in one voice (`FED001c` … `FED008a`,
  `KLI001a` … `KLI008b`, `ROM001b` … `ROM008b`): numbered and lettered like
  the vehicles' voice lines in the actor archives (line, then voice a-e),
  so probably generic unit responses.
- **Tutorials:** `Tutor01`-`tutor41` and `tut-2_01`-`tut-2_27` (MP3), the
  training and tutorial missions' speech (`cvr03.stb`'s `~INSTRUCTION~`
  pages).

Heard in recordings (found by cross-correlation, as the voice clips are;
F1's YouTube recording and K2's):

- A building's `com` line plays as it's finished (`B_fcycom` at 5:03, as
  the construction yard is; `B_fabcom` at 20:54, the accommodation block)
  and also in quick runs of different buildings, as the player goes
  through the build menu (8:18-8:28, 21:15-26:16): it's the building's
  spoken name.
- `lowpowr` two seconds before each "not enough power" message (K2 8:12,
  9:12); `atckvoc` after weapons fire is reported (F1 15:37-16:38, K2
  5:20); `objmet` as objectives are met (F1 26:46, 29:21, 31:10);
  `miswin` as the mission is won (F1 31:27).
- Of the eight lines: `FED002c` with both "held up" messages (F1 17:41,
  18:12: short of resources, of crew); `FED001c` as the vehicle yard is
  finished (7:22) and once later; `FED004b` as a scan starts (13:13);
  `FED005b` and `KLI005a`, short, every minute or so: acknowledging orders,
  presumably.

## Music (`Music`)

MP3s:

- **A theme per planet type**, about 2.9 MB each: `AlpineStart`
  (`alpwrld`), `DesertStart` (`deswrld`), `IceStart` (`icewrld`),
  `LavaStart` (`vlcwrld`), `MarsStart` (`redwrld`, the red / barren worlds)
  and `MountainStart` (by elimination `alnwrld`).
- **A theme per race met:** `Federation_`, `Klingon_`, `Romulan_`,
  `Hubrin_`, `Metar_`, `Taubat_Encounter`.
- **Stings per side** (Federation, Klingon, Romulan): big danger, colony
  in danger, general danger, mission failed, mission succeeded, objective
  met, mystery; and `birdofprey`, `RomBirdofPrey`, `fedcrashedss`.

`StarTrek.wav` (2.9 MB, in `Media/` itself) is presumably the main menu's
music.

## In Reluva

The shared audio code (`src/common/audio/`, for every engine) decodes both
formats: `decodeSound` picks WAV (PCM, IMA ADPCM) or MP3 (through minimp3,
`third_party/minimp3`) by content, and `Mixer` (`mixer.h`) plays any number of decoded sounds at
once: resampled to the output rate, each with its volume, pan and looping,
and music, speech and effects volumes for the game's settings. The data
viewer's sounds page lists the
game folder's loose `.mp3` and `.wav` files after the archives' sounds and
plays them; `reluva-tool newworlds wav-info` and `wav-decode` take MP3s too. The
missions page plays each mission's voice clips and its planet's theme (see
[level.md](level.md#in-reluva)). The voice
MP3s decode to within 1 of ffmpeg's samples. Stepping through a mission's
script (**X**), it plays the side's announcement for each step: the
building's name as it's finished, power low, production held up, an
objective met, the mission won or lost (`announcementFor` in
`mission_script.h`).

## Open questions

- Each mission's briefing script: which page and view go with each clip (seen for F1, K1, K2, J1, J2).
- Which of the eight lines per side is what (four of the Federation's are placed above).
